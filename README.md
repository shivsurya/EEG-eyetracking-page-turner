# EEG-eyetracking-page-turner
This project implements an automatic page turner with eye tracking based on EEG(Electroencephalogram).
This work was carried out as a part of my capstone project at Rashtriya Vidyalaya College of Engineering, 
Bangalore, India. Our Capstone project won the best Capstone project in Electrical Engineering award.

The original project was implemented in Embedded C. We created a simpler version on Arduino platform so 
that others can use that as a starting point of work if interested.

My role in the project were: 
1) Development of initial concept with Prof.Dinesh M.N(http://www.rvce.edu.in/eee_dinesh.php) 
2) Designed and built complete mechanical structure of the robotic page turner.
3) Signal Conditioning
4) Micro-controller coding.


The repository includes the following:
1)Project Report
2)Demonstration video
3)Arduino source code
