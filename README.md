# EEG-eyetracking-page-turner
This project implements an automatic page turner with eye tracking based on EEG(Electroencephalogram). This work was carried out as a part of my capstone project at Rashtriya Vidyalaya College of Engineering, Bangalore, India.

The original project was implemented in Embedded C. We created a simpler version on Arduino platform so that others can use that as a starting point of work if interested.

The repository includes the following:
1)Project Report
2)Demonstration video
3)Arduino source code
